# Steam Clone

## Overview

Game is one of the most popular industries nowadays. With the game being created every minute and relayed through TV, radio, and the internet, the updated news on a game is already old by the next morning. And, that’s why game publishers such as Steam created a website to help the user obtain the most updated information about games at the ease.

So, game lovers of Steam are reading news and info on games at the convenience of their work desktops or mobiles. The traffic of the news online services is rewardingly high. We could run ads and generate a good amount of money. 💰
A Steam-inspired web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. User can click any game item in the gallery to see the detail of only that selection's detail (name, tags, description, price, developer...), replacing the current gallery.
